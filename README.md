# pokedex-jquery

Pokedex that pulls the pokemon image up to match the name of the pokemon. Built using Jquery as practice using jquery and AJAX.

Plan to add a list of the pokemon with links to bring up the pokemon without typing in the name or the number of the pokemon. The side menu exists but I have to filter through the data to print the pokemon names. Will eventually add it.
